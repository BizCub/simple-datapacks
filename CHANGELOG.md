* The Global Datapacks option has been removed
* You can now specify paths to required and optional datapacks. This allows for more precise datapack customization in the game
* To use the mod as before with the Global Datapacks option enabled, you need to move the ```datapacks``` path from optional datapacks to required datapacks
