### Important changes
* The Global Datapacks option has been removed
* You can now specify paths to required and optional datapacks. This allows for more precise datapack customization in the game
* To use the mod as before with the Global Datapacks option enabled, you need to move the ```datapacks``` path from optional datapacks to required datapacks

### New changes
* Fixed a bug where required datapacks were incorrectly displayed in the selection menu during world creation
* Datapacks are now copied to the correct directory, and not only optional datapacks but also required ones are copied
